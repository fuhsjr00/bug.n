## Used hotkeys

The following tables list the base keys, i. e. a key without any modifier, and
their combination with the modifier keys (Alt: `!`, Ctrl: `^`, LWin: `#` and
Shift: `+`), which are used in bug.n. With this overview you may find unused
keys, which can be used for non-bug.n hotkeys or to reassign bug.n functions.
